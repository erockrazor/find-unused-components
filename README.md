# find-unused-components

An Angular utility written in Node that will find all unused components in your colossal Angular project. 

This tool requires that you modify the source code to point to the 'src' directory of your Angular project. 
This will tell the utility where to look on your local machine for the components both used and unused.
The app will write to the console how many components are not used within your project and specify their names.
